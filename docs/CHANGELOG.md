## [1.1.8] - 2025-01-24

### Fixed
- **Critical API Response Issue**: Fixed the issue where filtered slots were still appearing in the API response
- **Dual Filter Approach**: Enhanced the addon to use both `timetics_schedule_data_for_selected_date` and `timetics/admin/booking/get_entries` filters to ensure slots are properly filtered
- **Request Context Detection**: Added helper methods to detect staff_id, meeting_id, and timezone from various request contexts (GET, POST, REST API)

### Enhanced
- **Robust Slot Filtering**: The `process_api_response` method now properly filters out conflicting slots at the final API response level
- **Better Error Handling**: Added comprehensive logging for slot filtering in the API response processing
- **Request Parameter Detection**: Added support for detecting request parameters from multiple sources (URL parameters, POST data, REST API parameters)

## [1.1.7] - 2025-01-24

### Changed
- **Cleaner Slot Filtering**: Changed approach from marking slots as "occupied" to completely filtering out conflicting slots from the API response
- **Better User Experience**: Patients now only see truly available slots, eliminating confusion about why certain slots appear unavailable
- **Simplified Frontend**: No need for frontend JavaScript to handle occupied slot styling - only available slots are returned

### Enhanced
- **Improved Logging**: Updated log messages to clearly indicate when slots are filtered out due to Google Calendar conflicts

## [1.1.6] - 2025-01-24

### Fixed
- **Critical Time Format Bug**: Fixed the core issue where Google Calendar events were not blocking slots due to time format mismatch
- **Direct Conflict Detection**: Added direct conflict detection that properly compares 12-hour slot times with 24-hour Google Calendar event times
- **Time Conversion**: Added `convert_to_24h_format()` method to properly convert slot times from "10:30am" format to "10:30:00" format for accurate comparison

### Enhanced
- **Better Conflict Logging**: Enhanced debugging to show exact time comparisons and conflict detection results
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better error handling for time format conversion edge cases

### Technical Details
- The main issue was that Google Calendar events use 24-hour format (`10:45:00`) while Timetics slots use 12-hour format (`10:30am`)
- The original `strtotime()` comparison was failing because it couldn't properly parse 12-hour times without dates
- New direct conflict detection bypasses the flawed main Timetics Google Calendar sync method

## [1.1.4] - 2025-01-23

### Fixed
- **Google Calendar Blocking for Non-Logged Users**: Fixed critical issue where Google Calendar conflicts were not being detected for non-authenticated users
- **Improved Google Calendar Conflict Detection**: Enhanced the `check_google_calendar_conflict_for_slot()` method to properly detect when slots are blocked by Google Calendar events
- **Better Error Handling**: Added comprehensive debugging and error logging for Google Calendar integration issues

### Enhanced
- **Debugging Capabilities**: Added detailed logging to track Google Calendar conflict checking process
- **Staff ID Handling**: Improved handling of staff IDs for Google Calendar integration
- **Slot Detection Logic**: Enhanced logic to detect when slots are removed by Google Calendar blocking

### Technical Details
- Fixed the Google Calendar conflict detection to work with the main Timetics `block_timeslots_by_google_events()` method
- Added proper detection of when slots are blocked (removed) vs. available
- Enhanced error logging to help diagnose Google Calendar integration issues
- Improved compatibility with non-authenticated API requests

## [1.1.3] - 2025-01-27

### Fixed
- **Google Calendar Conflict Check**: Fixed issue where guest bookings could bypass occupied slot detection by using the actual selected date instead of today's date for Google Calendar overlap checks

### Technical Details
- Updated `check_google_calendar_conflict_for_slot()` method to accept and use the correct slot date from the schedule data
- Ensures occupied slot detection works consistently for both authenticated and non-authenticated users

## [1.1.0] - 2024-12-19
